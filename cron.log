  1) Project Operations

     CypressError: Timed out after waiting `60000ms` for your remote page to load.

Your page did not fire its `load` event within `60000ms`.

You can try increasing the `pageLoadTimeout` value in `cypress.config.js` to wait longer.

Browsers will not fire the `load` event until all stylesheets and scripts are done downloading.

When this `load` event occurs, Cypress will continue running commands.

Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `Project Operations`

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don't have internet access
  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn't accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

       "before each" hook for "Text model:claude-3-7-sonnet Prompts: 30":
     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

https://app.staging.bike4mind.com/

We attempted to make an http request to this URL but the request failed without a response.

We received this error at the network level:

  > Error: ESOCKETTIMEDOUT

Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don't have internet access
  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn't accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `30 Prompts`

     CypressError: Timed out retrying after 4000ms: `cy.should()` failed because the page updated as a result of this command, but you tried to continue the command chain. The subject is no longer attached to the DOM, and Cypress cannot requery the page after commands such as `cy.should()`.

Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:

> `cy.get('button').click().should('have.class', 'active')`

to

> `cy.get('button').as('btn').click()`
> `cy.get('@btn').should('have.class', 'active')`
